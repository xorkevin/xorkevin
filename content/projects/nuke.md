Nuke was designed as a frontend for the Governor project. I wanted to build a
UI that could facilitate testing the numerous services that compose Governor.
However, as the project grew, I wanted to also componentize various UI elements
for future reuse. Thus, Nuke became a UI library, which I have since used in
many other projects, including the LAHacks application system, and this blog
itself.
